<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
This is a Construct week project. I have to create a project within 4 days and my job is to make website more functionally there is some parts where I miss and some parts I done. This is my Individual Project where I have the oppertunity to learn many things like to search , Individual Work, time management and and project management, at the end of the every unit this will make us utilise all the new skills we have learnt from the unit and a perfect platform to practice our skills in the differnet work environment where we can utilise our potential of getting things workings together or Individually.
