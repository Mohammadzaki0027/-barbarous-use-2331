This Project is clone of Cricket.com webpage.
In this project My aim to build the cricket app webpage where user can see the score,news,scheduled
But the problem is I can not do it manually creating data and then showing.
I want the live data so I need a Api then I got Api by using Api I Append the Data.
This Project  I made by using React,Chakre-ui,HTML,CSS,Javascript.
React is a single page application 
So I use react-router-dom for connect different page and the data
required same for different page so I use ContextProvider so that due to this proops drilling is avoidable and data is easily acessible to each page
and avoid the each time Api call which is costly also so I use Context Api for this.
I used Chakra-ui for some styling and also CSS fro styling part
